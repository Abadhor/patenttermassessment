    When assessing a patent, the main objective is to evaluate the quality of pre-selected Search Term Candidates.
    The blue column in the middle contains all Search Term Candidates that have been selected for this particular patent (displayed on the left) using a certain method.
    For each candidate please choose on of three quality labels.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Good: </strong>The candidate term is strongly related to the patent and would make a good search term.</li>
      <li><strong>In Context: </strong>The candidate term is somewhat related to the patent but would NOT be a suitable search term.</li>
      <li><strong>Bad: </strong>There is no relationship between the candidate and the patent or the candidate is not even a term.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Furthermore, some Search Term Candidates also have potentially Related Terms, which are shown in the green column on the right whenever a Search Term Candidate is selected in the blue column.
    Please select one of the following relationships for each related term:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Synonym: </strong>The Related Term means exactly or nearly the same as the selected Search Term Candidate.</li>
      <li><strong>Hyponym: </strong>The Related Term is in a "type-of" relationship with the selected Search Term Candidate. E.g. pigeon is a hyponym of bird.</li>
      <li><strong>Hypernym: </strong>The selected Search Term Candidate is in a "type-of" relationship with the Related Term. E.g. animal is a hypernym of bird.</li>
      <li><strong>None: </strong>No relationship between selected Search Term Candidate and Related Term exists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    When you are done assessing a patent please go back to the dashboard and start with the next patent. All progress is saved automatically.
